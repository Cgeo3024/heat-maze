    <h2> Group Rooms </h3>
    
    <p> Group Rooms allow you to work with others to reach the room's goal</p>
    
    <p> Here all users work together to meet the room's goals. To do this you submit a vote for what you want the temperatures of each source to be set at.<br>
    Every 30 seconds this vote will be tallied and the median vote becomes the room's new settings.
    </p>
    
    <p> Each room is slightly different. </p>
